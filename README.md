# Gorillaz PCB Boards

This project offers an integrated pcb replacement for the Kinesys Advantage2. the view of this project is to offer a full pcb replacement including the thumb clusters.
all pcb are fully smd based. The Draw back will be the cost of the solution on order, but the benefit will be solderless solution. 

### The Hardware

### The Software
the firmware will be ZMK. 

## Attribution
This project would not be possible without the huge work done by 
https://github.com/dcpedit/pillzmod

The pcb design wouldn't have been possible withouth the guide from Moritz ebastler - https://github.com/ebastler/zmk-designguide

## Contribustions 
I am no pcb designer so I am very much looking for contributions and feedback to get the project to the finish line.
