# Gorillaz PCB Boards

This project offers an integrated PCB replacement for the Kinesys Advantage2. The view of this project is to offer a full PCB replacement including the thumb clusters.
The PCB components are almost fully SMD. The Draw back will be the cost of the solution on order, but the benefit will be solderless solution. 

### How is it different from other mods

Aside from being a fun project the main goal of this is to offer a simplified approach to Kinesys moddiing. 
- solder free installation (as much as possible)
- battery management with the ability to wake the board up from sleep by pressing a key (not possible with the nice!nano)
- Bluetooth

If there are feature you would like to see supported on the board, do get in touch. 
note that I am not planning on supporting the pedals at this stage.

### The Hardware


### The Software
the firmware will be ZMK. 

## Attribution
This project would not be possible without the huge work done by 
https://github.com/dcpedit/pillzmod

The pcb design wouldn't have been possible withouth the guide from Moritz ebastler - https://github.com/ebastler/zmk-designguide

## Contribustions 
I am no pcb designer so I am very much looking for contributions and feedback to get the project to the finish line.
